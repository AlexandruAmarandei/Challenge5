# Challenge5

To run the program, run the UI, not the Compiler.
UI is the interface.
Compiler is the interpretor.
Variable is the integer variable class.

The program can: 
- correct almost all sintax errors
- see if the variable is locally initialized
- do whiles
- do ifs
- do ifs with else
- have the following addiotional conditions: is, more, less (ex: while X is 0 do;)
- deal with comments
- solve ecuations by the command solve "variable" = ....; ( it can detect all error exept wrong ( ) placement)

Assumptions:
- using clear on an initialized variable will set it's value to 0
